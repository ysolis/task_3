Here are some important communication processes and tools that you can set up to track general code development, manage requests from developers, and track issues:

    - Communication tools:
        - Instant messaging: Instant messaging is a great way for developers to quickly and easily communicate with each other. There are many different instant messaging platforms available, such as Slack, Discord, and Google Chat.
        - Email: Email is still a valuable communication tool, especially for sending longer messages or messages that need to be archived.
        - Video conferencing: Video conferencing is a great way for developers to collaborate on code in real time. There are many different video conferencing platforms available, such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams.
    - Issue tracking tools: Issue tracking tools are used to track bugs, feature requests, and other issues in a project. There are many different issue tracking tools available, such as Jira, Trello, and Asana.
    - Code review tools: Code review tools are used to review code before it is merged into the main codebase. This helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and that it does not introduce any new bugs. There are many different code review tools available, such as Code Review App, Gerrit, and Phabricator.
    - The source code management tool is an important tool for your development teams, as it will be the basis of their workflow, one where they can have control of the issues recorded in the Issues tracking tool, or even take over that work. It should also include or allow the integration of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools. Here we can see tools such as Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, AWS CodeCommit, Google Cloud Source Code/Code Build and Gitea, which already include continuous integration in several cases and allow the integration of tools such as Jenkins, Concourse CD, Travis, DroneCI.

By setting up these communication processes and tools, you can help to ensure that your code development process is efficient and effective.

Here are some additional tips for improving communication in code development:

    - Be clear and concise in your communication. Developers are busy people, so they don't have time to read through long, rambling messages. Get to the point quickly and clearly.
    - Use the right communication tool for the job. If you need to have a quick conversation with a developer, use instant messaging. If you need to send a longer message or a message that needs to be archived, use email. If you need to collaborate on code in real time, use video conferencing.
    - Be respectful of your team members' time. Don't send unnecessary messages or messages that can be easily answered by looking at the code.
    - Be open to feedback. Developers are experts in their field, so be willing to listen to their feedback and suggestions.

By following these tips, you can improve communication in your code development team and help to create a more productive and enjoyable work environment.
